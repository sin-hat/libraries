# Libraries for robotics
This software are libraries for robotics.

## Probability density functions
These software are probability density functions. You can get the uniform probability density value,  
the exponential probability density value, the gaussian probability density value.

## Rondom functions
These software are random functions. You can get the uniform random value,  
the exponential random value, the gaussian random value.
